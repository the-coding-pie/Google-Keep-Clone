# Google Keep Clone (Frontend)

A Frontend Clone of Google Keep made with React, Typescript, Redux, Tailwind CSS, and Docker. The main intention behind this Clone was to learn Typescript With React + how to setup Docker. As I said, this is just a frontend clone - no backend, no databases, nothing fancy. But still I loved this build.
